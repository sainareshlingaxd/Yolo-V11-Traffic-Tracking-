# YOLOv7 Traffic Tracking

This project implements a real-time traffic tracking system using the YOLOv7 (You Only Look Once version 7) object detection model. The system can detect and track vehicles in video streams, providing valuable insights for traffic management.

## Features
- Real-time vehicle detection and tracking
- Support for various vehicle types (cars, trucks, buses, motorcycles)
- Output video with bounding boxes and vehicle counts
- Easy to set up and run with customizable parameters

## Getting Started
Follow the instructions below to set up and run the YOLOv7 Traffic Tracking project.

## Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- imutils
- PyTorch
- YOLOv7 weights and configuration files


### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yolov7-traffic-tracking.git
    cd yolov7-traffic-tracking
    ```
2. Install required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Download YOLOv7 weights from [the official YOLOv7 GitHub](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7) and place them in the `weights/` directory.


## Usage

To run the traffic tracking script, use the following command:
```bash
python main.py --input <path_to_video> --output <output_video_path> --weights <path_to_yolov7_weights>

python main.py --input video.mp4 --output output/video.avi --weights weights/yolov7.pt

## Model Training

If you wish to train the YOLOv7 model on your own dataset, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your dataset in YOLO format.
2. Modify the configuration file for your dataset and training parameters.
3. Run the training script:
    ```bash
    python train.py --cfg <path_to_yolo_config> --data <path_to_data_config> --weights <path_to_pretrained_weights>
    ```
4. Monitor the training process and adjust parameters as needed.
